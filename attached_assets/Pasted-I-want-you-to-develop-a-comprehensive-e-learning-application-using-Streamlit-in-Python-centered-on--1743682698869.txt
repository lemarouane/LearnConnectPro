I want you to develop a comprehensive e-learning application using Streamlit in Python, centered on managing and delivering educational content—specifically PDFs and videos—with a strong emphasis on security and distinct roles for admins and students. The goal is to craft an intuitive, visually captivating interface that empowers admins to control content and ensures students can securely access it for learning. Avoid rigid constraints like specific page counts; instead, let your creativity shape a solution that’s both functional and inspiring.

### Core Concept
- **Purpose**: Build a system where admins manage a rich library of PDFs (e.g., lecture notes) and videos (e.g., tutorials), while students consume this content in a controlled, secure way. It’s all about organizing educational materials and delivering them effectively.
- **Content Focus**: 
  - **PDFs**: Upload, store, and preview documents (e.g., "Algebra Notes.pdf").
  - **Videos**: Upload, stream, or link videos (e.g., "Calculus Intro.mp4"), with options for playback or thumbnails.
  - **Metadata**: Attach details like titles, difficulties, timestamps, or categories to enhance organization and usability.
- **Roles**:
  - **Admins**: Full control—upload, edit, delete, and organize content; manage users; oversee security settings. They’re the architects of the system.
  - **Students**: Limited access—view and interact with assigned PDFs/videos (e.g., download, stream, maybe add notes), but no ability to alter content or settings. They’re the learners.

### Design Vision
- **Visuals**: Create a bold, modern aesthetic—cards with a 45° gradient from coral (#ff6b6b) to teal (#4ecdc4), subtle abstract overlays (e.g., a white triangle or wave at 20% opacity), and a dynamic radial gradient for depth. Text is white, uppercase, bold (font-weight 700), centered, with 1px letter-spacing, on cards with rounded edges and a sleek shadow. Think “secure content vault” meets “futuristic learning hub.”
- **Content Display**: Show PDFs with previews (e.g., first page) and videos with thumbnails or embeds, all in responsive cards. Adapt the layout fluidly—spacious on desktop, compact on mobile—using Streamlit’s `st.markdown` with custom CSS.
- **UI Elements**: Buttons with hover effects (e.g., scale, glow), secure icons (e.g., locks for admins), and a polished, engaging feel that balances creativity with professionalism.

### Process
- **Setup**: Use Python with Streamlit as the core, SQLite for metadata (e.g., file paths, titles, user roles), and a secure file system for PDFs/videos. Pull in libraries like `PyPDF2` for PDFs, `Pillow` for thumbnails, `streamlit-player` for videos, or `cryptography` for security—whatever fits your vision.
- **Content Management**:
  - **Admins**: Enable seamless uploading of PDFs/videos (validate types, enforce size limits), editing metadata, and organizing content into a logical structure (e.g., levels, subjects, or custom tags). Provide tools to delete or replace files securely.
  - **Students**: Let them browse and access assigned content—stream videos, view PDFs—with a simple, content-first interface. Add optional interactivity (e.g., marking as completed, feedback) if it enhances the experience.
- **Security Features**:
  - **Authentication**: Require login for all users (username/password, hashed with `bcrypt`, or OAuth). Admins get full access; students get restricted views.
  - **Authorization**: Admins control everything; students only see their assigned content. Implement role-based access checks.
  - **File Security**: Encrypt uploaded files (e.g., `cryptography` library) and store them in a protected directory (hashed filenames, outside web root). Serve files dynamically to authenticated users only, decrypting on-the-fly.
  - **Logging**: Track admin actions (e.g., “Uploaded Calculus.mp4”) for accountability, visible only to admins.
- **Creativity**: Surprise me! Add features like content search, difficulty filters, or a stats dashboard for admins (e.g., most-accessed videos). Maybe include student progress tracking or secure content sharing. Make it uniquely awesome, but keep content and security at the core.

### Technical Notes
- Build with `streamlit` for the UI, `sqlite3` for metadata persistence, and secure file handling (e.g., `os`, `shutil`).
- Ensure uploads are validated and encrypted; serve files only to authorized users via Streamlit.
- Balance a rich content experience (uploading, viewing, organizing) with ironclad security—think of it as a digital safe for learning materials.

### Final Touch
Craft an app that’s a powerhouse for admins and a treasure trove for students. Admins should feel like they’re running a secure, cutting-edge operation, while students enjoy a slick, content-rich learning experience. Make it visually stunning, content-focused, and impenetrably secure—something that screams “This is the future of e-learning!”
