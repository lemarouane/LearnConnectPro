Project Overview:
"Zouhair E-learning" is an online educational platform where:

Admins (Zouhair) manage courses, subjects (matières), levels (bac+2 or others), students, and content difficulty.

Students register on the platform and are assigned courses based on their validation by the admin.

The platform offers features for restricting content sharing and controls over how content is accessed and used.

Key Features and Flow:
1. Admin Capabilities:
Login: Admins can log in securely to manage the platform.

Manage Students:

View and edit student information: Admins can update or delete student profiles.

Validate students: After reviewing the student's registration form, Zouhair validates them and assigns them to specific courses.

Assign students to a level (bac+2 or others): Zouhair will select the student's appropriate study level (e.g., Bac+2 or Bac+3) based on their profile.

Assign students to a specific matiere (subject): Based on the level, Zouhair will assign students to a relevant subject (e.g., Maths, Physics, Informatics).

Assign courses to students: Students can be assigned all courses for the selected subject or specific courses based on their needs.

Manage Courses:

Admins can create new courses by selecting a subject (matière) and level (bac+2 or others) from the database.

Course content: Admins can upload content in the form of PDFs or YouTube videos. For PDFs, they upload the file; for videos, they input the YouTube URL.

Course difficulty level: Courses will be categorized by difficulty (easy, medium, hard). Zouhair assigns these levels to the course content, ensuring that students see courses suitable for their understanding.

Course image: Admins upload a course image, which will be displayed alongside the course title on the platform's frontend.

Admins can edit or delete courses and reassign them to appropriate subjects and levels.

Manage Subjects and Levels:

Admins assign courses to specific subjects and levels, categorizing them accordingly.

Difficulty setting: Each course is tagged with a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) that helps guide the students based on their capabilities.

Content Protection:

Admins ensure that no student can download, copy, or share course content (PDF or video).

2. Student Capabilities:
Registration: Students fill out a registration form with personal details like name, email, phone number, etc.

Login: After registration, students log in to access their assigned courses.

Assigned Courses and Subjects:

Once validated by the admin, students will see the courses and subjects they’ve been assigned to.

Students can access all courses for a particular subject or only the selected courses as per Zouhair’s instructions.

Difficulty-based course access: Each student sees only the courses that match their level of understanding (easy, medium, hard). The system filters courses to show only those suitable for the student’s level.

Content Restrictions:

PDF Files: The platform will display the PDF file directly on the webpage. Students will only be able to view the content, not download or copy it.

YouTube Videos: YouTube videos are embedded directly on the platform, and the direct YouTube URL is hidden to prevent unauthorized access.

Screenshot Restrictions: Students are allowed only 3 screenshots per 15 minutes. Any attempts beyond this limit will be blocked, and the system will monitor and log all screenshot activity.

Admin Flow (Course Creation, Assignment, and Difficulty):
Login: Admin logs in to the platform.

Adding a New Course:

Admin selects the subject (matière) and level (bac+2 or others) from a list (pre-populated from the database).

Admin selects the content type (either PDF or YouTube video).

If the content is a PDF, the admin uploads the file; if it’s a YouTube video, the admin enters the URL.

Admin tags the course with a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) based on the target student group.

A course image is uploaded to display alongside the course title.

Assigning the Course to a Student:

After a student registers, Zouhair will review the student's registration details and validate them.

Once validated, the admin assigns the student to a specific course, subject, and difficulty level.

Student Flow (Course Access, Difficulty, and Content Restrictions):
Student Registration: Students fill out their registration form.

Login: After admin validation, students can log in to view their assigned courses.

Access to Course Content:

If the content is a PDF, the student can view it in a controlled viewer.

If the content is a YouTube video, it will be embedded on the platform.

Difficulty-Based Course Access:

Students will see courses tailored to their level of understanding: easy, medium, or hard.

This ensures that students receive courses appropriate to their proficiency level.

Screenshot Restrictions:

The system tracks student screenshots, limiting them to 3 per 15 minutes. Any attempt beyond this limit is blocked, ensuring no unauthorized content sharing.

Security & Restrictions:
Content Protection:

Students can view content but cannot download, copy, or share it.

For PDFs, the content is displayed in a view-only format, preventing downloads or copying.

For YouTube videos, the direct YouTube URL is hidden, and the video is embedded securely.

Screenshot Logs:

The platform will monitor and log each screenshot taken by a student, ensuring the limit is not exceeded.
